## ‚ú® Core Features

* **100% Offline:** After a one-time model download, Predic works without an internet connection.
* **Completely Private:** Your code never leaves your computer. Period. We value your privacy and intellectual property.
* **Instant Completions:** Uses a lightweight, quantized AI model that runs efficiently on your local hardware.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Get smart completions for modern web development.
    * JavaScript & TypeScript
    * React (.js, .ts, .jsx & .tsx)
    * CSS
* **Easy to Use:** Simply install from the marketplace and start coding. No complex setup or API keys required.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=your-publisher.predic).
2.  The first time it runs, Predic will download the AI model (approx. 150-200MB). You can see the progress in the status bar.
3.  Once the status bar shows **`$(zap) Predic: Ready`**, you're all set! Open a supported file and start coding to see suggestions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Predic uses a modern, two-process architecture to ensure the VS Code UI remains fast and responsive.

1.  **Extension Host:** The main extension (`extension.ts`) interacts with the VS Code API, captures your code context, and displays suggestions.
2.  **Agent Process:** A separate Node.js process (`agent.ts`) is forked to handle the heavy lifting. This agent loads a quantized AI model using the amazing [Transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) library and runs inference without blocking the main editor thread.

This design ensures that even during intense AI computations, your typing and editing experience remains silky smooth.

## üîß Contributing & Local Development

We welcome contributions! Whether it's a bug report, a feature request, or a pull request, we'd love your help.

To get started with local development:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sayemahamed/Predic.git
    cd Predic
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the Development Build:**
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```
5.  **Run the Extension:**
    * Press `F5` in VS Code to open a new Extension Development Host window.
    * This window will have the Predic extension loaded and ready to debug.
    * Logs and debugging output will appear in the **Debug Console** of your main VS Code window.
